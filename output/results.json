With more than 120 unique spells, 24 heroes, and a variety of powerful items, the game blends strategy, deck-building, and immersive combat. It\u2019s designed as a player-versus-player (PvP) experience, where mastery over the game's deep mechanics and deck synergy will determine the victor.\u00e2\u20ac\u2039 Good resource management, card synergy, clever hero combinations, and a bit of luck is all you need to win.\n\nPlayers take turns to battle each other's heroes, using spells, abilities, weapons, and arcane player-based magic. Both players place their heroes on the table in a 2-row, 6-slot grid. In your turn, draw cards until you have 7 cards on your hand, collect mana each turn, and spend mana on hero actions, spells, enchantments, or abilities.\n\nA hero can perform one action each turn by default, but this can get altered by abilities or spells. Heroes have hitpoints, which differ from hero to hero, based on class. Some heroes can heal allies, others can do massive AoE damage with spells. There are 6 different hero classes: Fighter, Assassin, Mage, Cleric, Bard, Ranger. Dice rolls are used to determine damage, based on the damage range of an attack, and the probability of certain spell effects. Dice from d4 to d10 are used for this game.\n\nThe player who manages to kill all the opponent's heroes wins the game.\n\nGame can be played 1v1 or 2v2.\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n",

Be careful though, only the player that lands the killing blow gets the glory! Players must strategize when to attack, when to defend, and where to stand. Players also have to contend with other players using their abilities to turn the game on its head, charging ahead of the pack, making a monster retaliate against someone else, or coercing other players into helping.\n\nThis is a deck building game that incorporates strategical movement on a tabletop board. We have removed as many dice as possible to prevent the game from being too luck based, allowing your own strategies by what cards you acquire to thrive. The game also has multiple strategic levels. What cards to acquire, where to move on the board, and when to attack. All of these can alter what other players might be planning!\n\n",

With this seeming simplicity is a very low barrier to entry for new players, but a lot of complexity, strategy, and deck building for dedicated players to maximize the win: loss of the game mechanics!\n\nAside from the game aspect of Esotera, it is also a cultural doorway to many religions, societies, fantasy, science fiction, and even Alien Conspiracy theory that unites all of these things into an easy to digest medium that will push the imagination and interest of the player.

The game combines streamlined combat and resource management and randomized 40-card decks made from a pool of 60 cards.\n\nKey Features:\n\nSingle-Copy Deck Construction:\n\nDecks are built using a 40-card limit, with no duplicates allowed. This forces players to explore the full card pool and build versatile, flexible strategies.\nPlayers must carefully select their cards, balancing power, synergy, and versatility within the constraints of the deck construction limit.\nRarity-Based Deck Construction Limit:\n\nPlayers must adhere to a strict rarity-based deck construction limit: 25 Commons, 13 Uncommons, and 2 Rares.\nThis rarity restriction adds a layer of strategy to deck-building, as players must decide how to allocate their limited higher-rarity slots for maximum impact. The commons will form the backbone of the deck, while uncommons provide critical support, and rares are the game-changing powerhouses.\nThe limitation encourages creativity and thoughtful deck composition, as players need to find the right balance between consistency and high-impact plays.\n\n    Dynamic Deck Generation *:\n\n\nWhile players can build their decks manually, they can also opt to use randomized decks, These decks are unique, offering a pre-built experience that still fits within the construction requirements.\nStreamlined Combat and Resource Management:\n\nThe game uses a simplified resource system where cards can either be played for their effects or used as resources to play other cards. This system ensures that gameplay is fast-paced and accessible, yet deep and strategic.\nCombat is centered around creatures, with each player trying to break through their opponent\u2019s defenses and have them take one of their life cards.\nResource Management and Life Card System:\n\nPlayers have a Resource Pool that grows each turn, enabling them to play increasingly powerful cards. The Life System is a player\u2019s life total, requiring opponents to break through their defenses before they can attack directly.\nEach life card can have hidden effects that trigger when taken, adding an element of surprise and strategic depth to the game.\nElement Identity:\n\nThe game features 6 elements, each with its unique playstyle and mechanics. Players can mix and match cards from different elements within the constraints of the deck-building rules, creating hybrid strategies that leverage the strengths of multiple elements.\nSome elements might focus on aggressive strategies, while others might excel in control, combo, or defensive playstyles.\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n",

Black Rose Wars: Rebirth is the second chapter in the Black Rose Wars series. Even though 25 years have passed after the Lodge was destroyed, Mages have not forgotten the Old Ways. The Black Rose calls to them. They return to the Lodge to repair and rebuild the glory of the Black Rose who still imbues every inch of the place, to hold their tournament to name the Crown Holder of the lodge for the following century. The Black Rose demands a champion.\n\nEvery player represents a Mage in this struggle to prove themselves as the true beholder of the Black Rose's power. The mages will program spells to their board and execute them in turn order. Those spells may disable other mages spells, arm traps, arm powerful defensive moves, deal damage, or summon otherworldly beasts. The battle is played out on a hexagonal arena that requires tactics and planning to ensure each mage can pull off the perfect move. When a mage finally succumbs to their wounds, they will die and return to their room. This disrupts position and planning but no mage is ever out of the fight!\n\nBlack Rose Wars: Rebirth plays well with 1-4 players and is best played with lots of players for even more interaction. The expansions add a very large amount of options for replayability as well. This game is a stand alone game as well as an expansion for the original Black Rose Wars game.\n\n",

Players choose their favorite mech to battle it out, with each mech offering a different loadout of cards to start the game and unique powers.\n\nEach turn, players play a card face-down. When both players have chosen a card, they reveal them. Cards resolve based on their speed if they haven't been interrupted. Weapons deal damage and interrupt the enemy, while defending avoids weapon hits. Upgrading offers you additional cards to add to your arsenal but is vulnerable to being interrupted. Lastly, recharge reloads spent cards.\n\nAs cards are played, they go to their owner's cool-down pile, where they remain until they're reloaded. As players take damage, the armor on their mech is destroyed. When enough armor is destroyed, an armor core becomes vulnerable and can be destroyed to stun that mech for the next turn. The game ends when a mech's armor is completely destroyed down to the last core.\n\n",
