To avoid being overwhelmed by the creatures, the Great God Nuwa used the magic of returning to the soul to create the Xiaoyao Illusion that temporarily trapping dangerous demons in it.\n\nThe celestial heroes of all time and space have received the message from Nuwa: Please come to the Illusion to conquer the demons and save the common people! The number of powerhouses with the highest merits will get my reward-go back in time and change the thing that makes you most regrettable. Therefore, the powerhouses from all walks of life have packed their bags and set off for the Xiaoyao Illusion.\n\nThe players are divided into two teams, A and B, according to the number of players in the game. Each player plays a different hero with special skills. Players take their turns one by one. A turn includes several phases, during which you can trigger event cards, play scrolls, and get equipped. The most important phase is the Battle Phase, during which you can trigger a battle with monsters. Your teammates can support you and your opponents can interfere. Cards and skills can be used to influence the battle. If you win, you get the winning effect and may keep the monster as your pet, otherwise, you have to get punished for losing.\n\nAfter the monster deck is empty, the team with higher points from pets wins! You can also win by killing all your opponents. Don't forget the love stories from the main video game because the heroes won't hesitate to sacrifice their lives to save their lovers!\n\n",

The game ends after 14 rounds. Highest score wins. Solo players must score 70 or more points per sigil card to win.\n\nDoom Cat comes with many goal cards that immerse you deeper into the world of sigil magic.

They work tirelessly on the Magi's automatons, enormous constructs fueled by the souls she has bound.\n\nThere have been heroes who have faced her and failed.
