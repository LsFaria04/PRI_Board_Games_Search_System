          "description": "King\u2019s: Cards and Creations is a Tabletop Card Game Engine that uses the customizable Core 135 Creation Card set to make and play different games; each with alternate and/or additional rules - letting players also customize their game play. Players are able, and encouraged, to write and/or draw on their Creation Cards.\n\nThe Core release, between website and rule book rules, contains 5 different games; Kingdrin, Minkingi, Fwords, Creca, and Pazuuru.\n\nIn Minkingi, 2 (or potentially more) players use Creation Cards to battle on what is known as the Active Field, vying for the most board control by the end of the game. Players take turns placing one of their cards into an open Active Field space, rotated in any direction to fit the orientation of the space, then declaring battles with other spaces. The player who controls the most Active cards at the end of the game, is the winner.\n\nKingdrin, however, plays completely differently! 2, 3, 4 or even 5 or more players pool their Creation Cards to one pile, then everyone draws 7 cards. Players take turns declaring and playing cards on top of the Ditch, matching different symbols or numbers to the top ditch card, drawing when they can't. Things get intense when players add 'The Kingdrin Speed Rule' card; and turn order is replaced with players playing as fast as they can! The player who runs out of cards first is the winner.\n\nCreca, while similar to Minkingi, is a much deeper dive into player engagement. Deck and drafting construction, Skills and abilities, as well as heavier gearing towards Card Layouts and new Fields. It uses the Active Field as well, but instead players are racing to control the first five Active Cards at the end of a turn. Creca also implements longer player turns, with different steps in each turn, giving players more choices (and hard decisions!) to deduce optimal plays from.\n\nWith player made content (on cards or in games), different games running under one engine (and many more in the works!), and expandable content through Card Layouts like Alt Rule Cards, Source Cards, and Token Cards; the potential is actually endless.\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n",

His first incursion was thwarted by the Sages, but in the titanic battle that ensued the Triforce was shattered; without its binding power to hold the the Kingdom of Hyrule together, the world itself became fragmented and disjointed, with the shadows of many worlds extending through the myriad dimensions of time and space.  The shards of the Triforce are scattered among these, and a hero must rise again to search for and rebuild the sacred symbol of power, courage and wisdom.\n\nHowever, this time, the hero is many\u2026\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Clockwork Realm is a cooperative game for 2-4 players, where each player will guide the various shadows of the hero, Link, in his journeys across Hyrule and into the dungeons scattered across the lands in his quest to reconstruct the sacred Triforce.\n\nEach game of The Legend of Zelda: Clockwork Realm takes place over four consecutive levels, with the first level being the easiest and each increasing in difficulty as the game goes on.  Each level is comprised of a dungeon that the heroes will explore in an attempt to find the dungeon's boss. The heroes must then defeat the boss in order to gain more Triforce Shards.\n\nThe game employs a form of deck-building to allow the players to level up their heroes.  Each deck starts with just some basic skill cards representing a hero's Power, Courage and Wisdom.  The heroes can add items and treasures to these decks to power up their abilities throughout the game.  The players will then play these cards to perform actions during the different phases of the game.\n\nAt the end of Level 4, the heroes will face the all-powerful Ganon in a final showdown to determine whether they save Hyrule and win the game, or whether Hyrule will be plunged into an era of darkness under the rule of a new dark lord...\n\n",

          "description": "Districts: Barcelona is a game for up to 4 players about the different interests and tensions that transforms a city over time and how they are related. The City works as an ecosystem and its citizens try to adapt and transform it to match their needs. Sometimes, such changes come as a by product of some direct actions, some other times it comes from direct developments that come through the administration or private investments.\n\nWe assess that it\u2019s not possible to witness such changes and transformations as a neutral witness: everyone is biased by its own experiences and perspective. Due to that, we have developed the different factions as how they perceive themselves. That is, portraying each of them per their own self-defined virtues and what they consider works best for most of the citizens, when not for everyone. Of course, as after all this is a game, for the sake of game balance we have adjusted certain values and actions to provide a better playability.\n\nThe game is designed for 4 players (but rules are provided for 3 and 2 players) and the city map is divided in districts. Each district has an array of values that describe its economic and population statistics. These values are a common pool for all the players, this means that your actions deplete some values to increase others, but doing so you might enable a 2nd player to play its actions in that district.\n\nThe game has no luck component whatsoever, players' actions have a basic effect no matter where they play them, and an additional effect if certain values are matched. Each faction consumes certain resources and generate others, and not a single faction is autonomous: each of them requires at least one resource they can not generate.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n",

How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?\n\nMage Wars \u2014 redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy \u2014 pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts \u2013 all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!\n\nMage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called \"zones\", which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.\n\nEach player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells \u2013 such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments \u2013 are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.\n\nEvery Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:\n\n\n    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.\n    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.\n    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.\n    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.\n\n\nThe base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.\n\nNew Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game. The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!\n\nExtra copies of spells available with:\n\n    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 1\n    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 2\n\n\n",

          "description": "Phantom Epoch is a fully cooperative tactical combat roleplaying board game with a persistent, choice-driven, 40+ mission campaign that blends sci-fi and fantasy themes.\n\nIn a galaxy where the secrets of interstellar travel have been lost to time and primitive peoples war over ancient technology, players are thrust into missions to stop an encroaching threat. As they play through missions on numerous planets with a variety of biomes, they will discover the true nature of their enemy, and will have the opportunity to unearth the rich story of the world of Phantom Epoch.\n\nA wide range of character choices, including human and alien species which can be combined with a diverse set of classes, allows players to create and grow their own characters to match their own play style. Each mission has its own map, objectives, enemies, and challenges. Every map has a completely unique layout. No two missions will be the same, and players will have to adjust their strategies accordingly.\n\nOutside of missions, players will need to gather resources to repair and restore functionality to the starship that serves as their headquarters. Doing so will unlock facilities to improve their characters with upgraded equipment, attributes, and skills. As secrets from the past are revealed, they will gain combat knowledge in the form of branching advanced classes that allow players to further customize and empower their characters.\n\nBefore missions, players prepare their equipment and Action cards that they'll bring with them on a mission. During a mission, players and adversaries simultaneously select Action cards at the start of each round. The selected cards determine the turn order for the round. During their turns the players and adversaries play the selected action cards one at a time. The campaign is made up of 40+ missions, and ends when the final story mission is played. As a fully cooperative game, players win a mission together by completing the mission objective, or lose together when all players are defeated or the objective is failed.\n\n",

It's an outpost barely surviving the harsh weather let alone invasions from forces both known and unknown. However, a group of mercenaries, at the end of their rope, will help bring this settlement back from the edge of destruction. Not only will they have to deal with the harsh elements, but with other, far more dangerous threats out in the unforgiving cold, as well. There are: Algox, the bigger, more yeti-like cousins of the Inox, attacking from the mountains; Lurkers flooding in from the northern sea; and rumors have it that there are machines that wander the frozen wastes of their own free will. The party of mercenaries must face all of these perils, and perhaps in doing so, make peace with these new races so they can work together against even more sinister forces.\n\nFrosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign.  Characters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.\n\nIn addition to using the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven features other elements, such as mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how the ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress.\n\nFrosthaven has a whole new set of items but there is a mechanism for bringing items over from 'Gloomhaven'. However, as Frosthaven's outpost is a remote location, these products may be imported but are not present as standard items. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items through a crafting system rather than just buying them.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n",
