          ],
          "description": [
            "The Buntu Circus was independently published by a group of UK gamers calling themselves The Buntu Circus. It is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players. The board is divided into a 14 x 14 grid. Each square has a combination of one of eight colours and one of twelve symbols, arranged in a symmetrical pattern on the board.\n\nA deck of cards has one card per square on the board, matching colour and symbol. Each player gets a hand of eight cards and a set of counters and rubber hoops in their own colour. These are metallic colours, distinct from the board colours.\n\nIn turn each player draws and then plays a card from their hand, placing or removing a counter on one of the appropriate squares on the board - each colour and symbol combination appears in two places on the board, and has two cards which can match.\n\nThe idea is to get a number of linked rows of five counters in your colour, orthogonally and/or diagonally. The target number of rows depends on the number of players - five in a two player game and less if there are more players. Once a row has been formed, it is designated by placing hoops over each of the counters in the row.\n\nThere are couple of further wrinkles. Most importantly are the \"power\" colours. At the start, each player has power in a single board colour, determined randomly. This allows the player to use a card of that colour to move an counter on the board (their own or another player's) either to an adjacent square of that colour or from a square of that colour to an adjacent square. Creating a row of five gains the player power over the colour of the middle square of the row - this is marked by removing the central counter from its hoop and placing it on one of the power colour markers to the side of the board. In this way players gain power over new colours. If another player already has power in that colour, their power is removed - but the player who gained power merely displaces them - they do not gain power in the colour. Gaining power over a colour in which you already have power reinforces power in the colour. The player \"hoops\" the power counter and this prevents any other player from gaining a row that would give them power in that colour. In effect they have a \"lock\" on that colour. A final wrinkle comes with the discard piles. Played cards can be discard to one of four face-up piles. Once one of the four \"draw\" decks is exhausted, the adjacent discard pile is turned over - but not shuffled. This allows long-term strategies of \"stacking\" the deck with particular colours or symbols.\n\nThe quality of the components is superb. The board is big and colourful, the symbols clear and distinct. The player's counters are chunky plastic discs which come in little cannisters like pill-boxes. The hoops are rubber-like rings which come in individual cloth bags. Very satisfying to \"hoop\" your rows with.\n\n"

Learn to manage a dojo in ten minutes then spend a lifetime mastering the martial way. Adapt your mat position and craft a deck of attack and defense skills to combat your opponent. Balancing tactics and strategy, play the player across the tables as much as the dojos.\n\nPlayers balance the use of Stamina and Experience Points to build a deck of attack and defense cards from their dojo of skills in order to adapt to an opponent's evolving strategy. Holds create an opening for an attack and often work in combination with other moves. Stuns break an opponent's rhythm leaving her without enough stamina to pull of offensive combos. Takedowns are advanced moves that put the opponent on the mat defenseless.\n\nThe linear mat component allows players to control distance to avoid damage and get in range to strike their opponent providing an additional level of tactics and strategy.\n\nLasting about 30 minutes, no two fights are ever the same. With each new bout, new strategies emerge\n\n"

Most trick cards will be resolved, or Landed, by a roll of the dice. Action type cards are divided into Steeze and Stoppers, where Steeze cards will usually help, while Stoppers hinder your opponent. Location Cards are where all the magic happens. Activate your Local, Gnarly, and Heroic spots to gain an edge over your opponents!\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n"

            "Welcome to the world of All Hallows' Eve, a never ending rush to grab the candy before the Monsters grab you! In this game, you can take either the role of the Chaperone in charge of keeping all the Trick or Treaters safe or as one of the many Monsters inhabiting this world. Who will win? Will the Trick or Treaters gather the candy before the Monsters get them all? Grab your candy bag and head out onto the leaf-strewn streets to find out!\n\nThe Chaperone bookends rounds by moving teams of Trick or Treaters towards houses with the goal of keeping them alive and collecting all the Candy with at least one Trick or Treater staying alive by the end of the game. Everyone else plays as one of the Montsers, each with an personalized deck of attacks and abilities with the goal of gobbling up as many Trick or Treaters as possible before they collect the last piece of Candy. If the Chaperone collects all the candy they win. If the Monsters gobble up all the Trick or Treaters, the Monster with the most Trick or Treaters collected wins.\n\n"

The object is to capture your opponent's King (and Crown Prince, if they have promoted their Drunk Elephant).  Unlike Modern Shogi, this game is played without drops.\n\nThe game is much larger than Chess and Shogi.  The pieces consist of such interesting pieces as the Drunk Elephant, Phoenix, Kylin, Free Boar, Flying Ox, and many other colorfully-named pieces including the incredibly powerful Lion.\n\n"
