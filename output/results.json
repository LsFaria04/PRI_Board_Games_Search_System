Players start by choosing one of the four magi classes, each of which have a unique ability to be used during the game. While taking turns players choose sets of spells to include or exclude in the game. Once this phase is complete, the chosen cards of each spell type are then shuffled together and placed on the board in the appropriately labeled spots. Staged face-up, the cards are drafted one at a time from the board as each player builds their own customized deck of spells. Once deck building is complete, the game board is flipped over to the dueling ground side and players engage in a spell casting fight to determine the winner. Part of the dueling strategy is gamesmanship in the form of alliances and negotiations. Do what you must to ensure you survive to the end.\n\n"

            "Kazuni is a board game that brings all the strategy of building and maintaining supply chains to life in a way that is fun and refreshing.\n\nPlayers begin by building factories that are used to produce supply crates for a starving city. These crates are delivered as player explore a dynamic, mystery board and purchase the transportation needed to move those crates.\n\nPlayers are faced with economic challenges while also handling the randomness of an Opportunity Deck that furthers their chains or inhibits their opponents.\n\nPlayers collect their income for the turn, then take two actions which can be map exploration, supply chain construction, and/or drawing a card from the deck. After performing their actions, any supply crates that currently exist within a player's supply chain will move according to their capacity.  After cargo crates have moved along the supply line, players end their turn by building additional supply crates at any and all factories the player has constructed.\n\nOnce a player has successfully delivered 25 crates from their factories to the center tile (City tile) they win the game!\n\n"

With a gameplay centered around double-deck-building, be the first to get 10 gold ingots to be crowned King/Queen of GOLDblivion!\n\nIn GOLDblivion, you have two decks of cards to manage: one for combat and one for development. Every turn starts by removing a card from your hand. This card is placed under a chosen section of your player board and will give a precious resource all game long! This process will also naturally clean your deck from bad cards.\n\nCombat is made by conquering territories represented by hexagonal tiles. The number of free spaces around a tile is the number of cards you draw from your combat deck to defeat the enemy under this territory. They get increasingly stronger and are more rewarding too!\n\nBased on the ever-changing cards in the market, develop a long-term strategy and find the best combinations between Elf, Dwarf, Human and Building cards to maximize your gold and be crowned King/Queen of GOLDblivion!\n\n"
