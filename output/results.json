            "In Caty Mini, first released as Kociaki \u00c5\u0081obuziaki, each player has their own unique game board that represents a children's room where a cat is playing; the cat is chasing twine that goes from one piece of furniture to another, with the game board having cutouts for twine to run through. The object of the game is to guide your cat so that it can grab as many toys as possible while running in the room.\n\nEach round, the round's starting player chooses a furniture card from their hand and places it face-up on the pile of cards in the middle of play. Each player then takes a turn in clockwise order to move their string and score, if possible. \"Moving the string\" means stretching your string across your board and through a slot on either side of the furniture that matches the card played. If the string touches the object on the floor, that player scores chip tokens. Whoever collects the most points wins!\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\nNominations and Awards:\n- 2020 - Boardlive Awards 2020 Children's Game Winner (South Korea)\n- 2021 - EducaFlip 2021 Winner - The Best Educational Game (France)\n- 2021 - Jokers 2021 - The Best Game for age 6+ Nominee (Belgium)\n\n"

            "Peer-to-Peer is a team vs team semi-cooperative deck-building game using the Second generation (2021) Tech Deck, a 21st century deck of playing cards. Players divide into two teams and share a play deck and group hand. Each individual player has asymmetric abilities from their venture (Tech Deck cards) that can develop over time. Teams compete to assist customers from the Customer deck. Successfully assisted customers can be used to: 1. build up their team's deck, 2. develop individual ventures, or 3. score. Rules for odd-number of players and solo-play are included. The theme of the game is a 21st century modern setting. Players on a team cooperate together. Teams may choose to cooperate and negotiate and assist customers (semi-cooperative) leading to lively group discussion and dynamics. The game uses simple math and card melds to determine who successfully assists customers. There are three mutually-exclusive competing objectives: 1. to develop your team's deck, 2. to develop individual player's venture and 3. to score customers. Teams compete to assist customers and then the team must choose how to use that customer card towards these three objectives.\n\nOBJECTIVE \u2013 Teams are trying to score points from assisting customers while building up their team\u2019s deck and ventures.\nGAME PLAY \u2013 During a turn, players can uses game effects from their hand cards and their ventures. Both teams try to assist customers in the customer row drawn from the customer deck. The game ends when there are no more cards left in the customer deck.\n\n-description from designer\n\n"

How many boys and girls should you bring? Will you bring a girl secretly dressed up as a boy to foil your opponent's plans?\n\nBoth players start with a secret goal, and need to manipulate the gender mix in play to fulfil their goals. There are opportunities to swap your secret goal and to change the gender of a dancer. When a round ends, you reveal your goals to compare who has done better. There are instant-win conditions on some cards. If you manage to achieve these feats, you win a round immediately.\n\nThis short and tricky card game features bluffing, setting traps, pushing your luck and reading your opponent.\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n2021 BGG 9-Card Nanogame Print-and-Play Design Contest Best Overall Game\n2021 BGG 9-Card Nanogame Print-and-Play Design Contest Best 2-player Game\n2021 BGG 9-Card Nanogame Print-and-Play Design Contest Best New Designer\n2021 BGG 9-Card Nanogame Print-and-Play Design Contest Best Rule Book\n\n"

The cards are double-sided, with one side being the Empire Attackers besieging Malacca, while the flip side is the Sultanate's Defenders trying to hold them at bay. The game also uses a creative area control mechanic that simulates the Frontline of battle. This makes vying for the right cards and spaces on the battlefield key to winning the war.\n\nThe Portuguese Empire plays as a Deck Builder, building up their strength to unleash increasingly deadly attacks against the city. The Sultanate plays as a Set Collection, Tableau + Engine Builder, adding Fighters to their city to bolster up defenses and making it easier to defeat enemies on future turns.\n\nAwards:\n\nFrom the 2020 54-Card Game Design Contest.\n-Best War Themed Game: 1st Place!\n-Best Solo Game: 2nd Place!\n-Best Euro Game: 2nd Place!\n-Best Overall Game: 3rd Place!\n-Jury Prize: 3rd Place!\n-Best 2 Player Game: 3rd place!\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n"

            "A game of trivia, teamwork, & campaign strategy. Ages 10 and up, for 2-8 players.\nELECTION! The Presidential Campaign Game\n2nd Edition\nOverview:\nCitizens vote to elect our president. In this game, you can lead the campaign! ELECTION! is a game of trivia, teamwork, & campaign strategy. Players compete to be the first party to claim the most electoral votes in an American Presidential election campaign. Players lead their party\u2019s campaign for president by raising funds and purchasing Town Hall, Advertise, and Charisma cards to earn votes. Then with votes in hand, they strategically claim State's electoral votes and ensure their party's victory. Game Play:\n\nEach turn involves three actions.\n1 Roll dice\n2 Buy Cards\n3 Claim States\nACTION 1: Players can choose to roll the dice to raise funds. ACTION 2: They can opt to buy cards to build their campaign and earn popular votes. For example, buy a Town Hall trivia card to test your knowledge of history, State Capitals, State nicknames, and more. A correct response earns the votes. ACTION 3: With popular votes in hand, the players use them to win selected States on the score ballot.\n\nPlayers may also \"endorse\" a teammate after their three actions. This is done by forwarding cards to a teammate's hand, pooling cards and votes to claim more States during their turn. Can the party now claim enough electoral votes to win the election?\n\nGame progress is kept on the score ballot. The score ballot lists all 50 states and DC, and is sorted based on presidential election results from 1988 through 2008. There are states that lean red, states that lean blue, and swing states in the middle. States that lean toward the player's political party require fewer popular votes to claim. The swing states are equal for each party, and are more difficult for both. By claiming states with earned votes, players win electoral votes for their party and work toward victory. The electoral votes listed are current for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections.\n\n"

            "Tyrants of the Underdark is a territory control game with a deck-building element.\n\nEach player leads a house of Drow in a section of the Underdark below the Sword Coast. The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your \"inner circle\", which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.\n\nWhen you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.\n\nA central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.\n\nPlayers gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.\n\nNOTE: This 2021 printing includes the Aberrations & Undead expansion.\n\n"

            "High Rise is a strategic city-building game with a bit of corruption. You can get bonuses on your actions by gaining Corruption, but the game will periodically penalize the most corrupt players, and everyone loses VP for Corruption at the end of the game.\n\nYou'll perform all your actions \u2014 like collecting resources, constructing buildings, and repaying favors \u2014 on a one-way track. Like other one-way track games, you can go as far as you'd like, but you'll only get another turn when everyone else passes you. You gain 1 VP per floor for each building you construct. Tenants offer powerful actions that change each game. You can collect a tenant power by landing on its space or constructing a building on its card.\n\nThe round ends after everyone makes a lap around the one-way track. Players score bonus points for tallest buildings in each neighborhood and the game. You'll play 2 rounds in the Standard Game (about 90-120 minutes for 3-4 players) and 3 rounds (about 2.5 hours) in the Full game. After the appropriate number of rounds, players lose points for Corruption, and the player with most VP wins.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n"

            "The AI takeover is upon us. It's as bad as we feared.\n\nRobot Rising is a solo deck-building game where you must program the bots (cards) in your hand to quell the AI takeover. Each turn, new bots may join the uprising, making it more difficult to regain control. Use Config Settings to maintain your bot population, keep your Code clean to avoid compromising CPUs, and Install USBs with data patches to regain control of mutinous bots. Can you find a way to keep the robots from rising to power? Humankind depends on it...\n\nYour objective is to regain control of all the bot cards in the Uprising deck to quell the rebellion before the bots compromise ten CPU chips and take control of the world.\n\nEach bot card in Robot Rising has a helpful ability when you control the bot, and a separately harmful effect when the bot instead joins the uprising.  The game is played in rounds until you've either defeated all bots in the uprising or the bots have hacked all your CPU control.\n\nEach round, you start by rolling a die - the Bot Roll - any card in the population with a matching value will join the uprising, and is another bot you will have to regain control of in order to win.  Next, the active bots in the uprising take actions based on the bottom of the card. After the uprising bots have finished their turn, you may use the bots in your control to fight back.  You can Code lines (improve your health), Install patches in uprising bots (each bot requires a certain amount of USBs before falling), gain Configuration Settings (the game's currency), and lots more!  At the conclusion of each turn, you may acquire bots from the population if you have adequate Config to do so.\n\nRobot Rising was designed for the 2021 54-Card Game Design Contest on BGG\n\n"

            "Energetic 2.0 is a new edition of Energetic, the 4-6 player cooperative board game about the future of New York City that's now used at 27 universities around the world.\n\nYou play from 2021 to 2035, a turn each year. Your team must work together to balance your budget, your grid stability, and your public opinion to keep the lights on, win elections, overcome climate impacts, and build 16 gigawatts of clean power for the city. Then you will have replaced all fossil fuels, provided there is a matching reduction in demand from behavior change and efficiency.\n\nOur objective is to give players a quick grounding in what solving climate change actually means, in a physical and social sense, based on demand of energy and the types of renewable or carbon neutral generation that can supply 8 million New Yorkers.\n\nWe hope playing this game can make your role in the coming decade more effective, better informed, and more powerful, and that by providing a tangible vision of what part of the solution looks like, society can begin the necessary step of reorienting itself towards this larger goal. It's a lot of fun, too!\n\nEnergetic 2.0 is factory-produced and beautifully made, with a very large folding board and additional cards for Wildfire Smoke and Extreme Precipitation in the Event decks. Sets come with a 52 page guide to the cards and information in the game, as well as a map board, three card decks, 142 infrastructure pieces, and more.\n\nDuring development, Energetic 1.0 was tested and enjoyed by people ages 11 to 60, including middle school students, MIT energy PhDs, former commodity traders, and leaders at environmental NGOs. The game is in use at organizations including Yale University; Carnegie Mellon University; Nature Energy; NYSERDA; Con Edison; Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC); and the British Government's Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy.\n\n\u2014description from the designer\n\n"

            "In Dark Domains each player takes on the role of a city leader attempting to expand the frontier of Harrows into the hinterland. Unbeknownst to the powers in Harrows some of those leaders, namely the players, are secretly evil to the core and in the thrall of the Necromancer. Once away from the bustling city and the oversight of the courts, these overlords create domains that outwardly appear to be beacons of light and hope. Eventually however, their true colors will come through and those upstanding pillars of the community will retreat to their lairs as the masquerade ends and their lands begin to decay into wastelands overrun by foul monsters and nefarious henchmen.\n\nBut all is not peaches and cream in the lands of darkness. Harrows is home to the famous Torin Company and its never-ending supply of heroes and adventurers. Once the word reaches Harrows that darkness is afoot in the Domains, it is only a matter of time before these nosy adventurers begin to seek out the dens of horror to stop the evil.\n\nDark Domains is a worker placement game where 2-5 players attempt to create a Domain that provides them the most evil, depicted in the game by skulls. Players must use Minions, Henchmen, Monsters & Magic to stamp out the good, repel the Torin Company and cover their land in darkness.\n\nTarot cards are used in the game as events to live up each turn and to regulate the phases of the game.\n\n"

            "Hindsight: 2020 is a real-time cooperative dice-drafting puzzle game for 1 to 4 players. On your turn, you will select two dice of the same color from a grid of 36--the first, the ACTION DIE, determines your main action by its position and your bonus action by its value; the second die, the POWER DIE, determines the strength of first action. You will use the actions to manipulate the puzzle tiles, to alter the dice in the grid (for future turns), and to manage the timer. The adjustable difficulty level will keep you on your toes for play after play as your team gets better at solving the puzzle quickly. Thinky and frantic, saving the world has never been so fun.\n\nTheme:\nThe apocalypse is upon us! If only we\u2019d seen it coming. Luckily for the rest of humanity, you\u2019ve just finished the prototype for your new time-intervention device. Alas, it\u2019s a little unstable and unreliable--it is a prototype, after all. You\u2019ve figured out what intervention is needed to stop the apocalypse, but it takes some tinkering to get the machine aligned so your operatives can make those changes. You have just a couple minutes to find the right configuration of your machine to send back our intervention agents and save the world. Can you finish before the apocalypse arrives? Time to find out.\n\nSaving the world, as fast as you can. The game has two play areas, a 6 by 6 dice grid, and a tile tableau. The dice grid has twelve actions you may take, one for each row and one for each column. At the top of the tile area are six \u201ckeystone\u201d tiles numbered 1-6, representing the code you need to match. In an array of 36 tiles below the keystone line are columns of similar tiles.\n\nWhen you select your Action die, you place it at the end of either the row or the column, indicating which action you intend to take. Then you select your Power die, another die of the same color, and place it on the Power die space outside the grid. The action you selected is augmented by the Power die, and allows you to manipulate the tile tableau or the dice grid. After you take your main action, you get a secondary action determined by the value of the action die you took. These secondary actions allow you to flip the sand timer and add more dice to the grid, among other things.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, you need to manipulate the tiles so that the top of each column matches the keystone number above it. When the number matches, you can \u201clock\u201d that combination in place, triggering the bonus (or penalty) card attached to that column. You win if you are able to lock all six columns before you run out of dice or timer flips. Of course, if you ever let the timer run out, you also lose.\n\nThis is how the world ends:\nAccompanying Hindsight: 2020 is a thematic website that uses your six-digit keystone code to reveal what happened to cause the apocalypse, and how your team did or did not succeed in preventing the end of the world.\n\n-description from designer\n\n"

            "Far to the south of The Last Ruin lies a cliffside village called The Monument. For generations, it protected an ancient shrine until the day a crystal meteorite descended. The meteor's denizens slowly crept out into the world\u2014bizarre monstrosities from nightmare, attacking all in their path. As they spread across the land, there was no intelligent malice nor grand invasion strategy; the creatures acted like a fungus\u2014spreading into new territory sporadically. After many fruitless attempts to expel the monsters, the people of The Monument fled as their village crumbled, exiled to distant lands, resigned to a nomadic existence.\n\nTwenty years later, there are rumors that the bizarre monsters are growing weak. They\u2019re slower, less impervious to attack, some undergoing a gradual petrification until they crumble to dust. Is it the atmosphere? Are they dying of old age? Do they suffer from a strange disease? No one is certain, but as the news spreads, various factions set their eyes on the vacant, ruined village of The Monument. The original villagers, now refugees, are desperate to return and rebuild. But they must do it quickly, before someone else claims their home. This is their chance. It\u2019s now or never.\n\nIn Now or Never, you and up to three friends compete to best rebuild your ancestral village and guide the rest of the villagers on their journey home. Although the creatures of the meteorite have lost much of their strength, many of them remain, and you must fight them off to protect traveling villagers. Now or Never is the third game in the Arzium storybook series that includes Above and Below and Near and Far.\n\nNow or Never is a competitive strategy game that allows you to:\n\n\n     Choose one of four asymmetrical characters to play.\n     Rebuild the village so that returning villagers have a place to live. You must carefully choose what and where to build to maintain an advantage, earning the biggest rewards for long-term planning.\n     Interact with other players by hiring their specialists to perform special actions.\n     Combat dangerous creatures to rescue villagers.\n     Explore a fantasy landscape filled with bizarre places, technology, and peoples.\n\n\nNow or Never includes two modes of play: standard and story. When playing in story mode, you read from a storybook when you explore, making choices and learning more about the characters and the world. Each character has their own set of stories, unique to the locations they explore and diverse in plot, perspective, and motive, allowing you to choose what direction your own story will take.\n\nJourney to The Monument and help rebuild your ancient home!\n\n-description from publisher\n\n"

The four types of cards allow the different train speeds (normal, express, limited express, express special).\n\nThe game was made in a simple draw bag, and includes a blank d6 for a special undisclosed function.\nuser summary\n\n"
