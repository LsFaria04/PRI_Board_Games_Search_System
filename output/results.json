In Block Master, your best tactic is to collect that bad karma now and give it to your opponents to get the win. Use your Karma Crystal to block other players from moving through the positive karma path and win!\n\nThis 1st entry into the Karma Crystals game collection introduces many of the mechanics we use in all our games, including the Roll Off, Karma Crystals to share bad karma, monster elemental cards and dice matching, game end triggers and completion of the round prior to determining a win, playoffs using game win shards, and auto players. This game features the use of karma move and Block Trophy shards and FOUR monster elemental cards to start your collector\u2019s deck!\n\nRoll dice to work with the various monster elemental cards - monsters are the good guys and help you win! Determine how many karma moves you score per roll and collect your karma move shards, or pass on your no-match karma to another player by attempting to block one of three possible move scores to get a blocking trophy! If you get 11 or more karma moves, that triggers the end the game and a winner is determined at the end of that round!\n\nIn addition to the unique dice matching game mechanic, a unique auto player system is also used to facilitate up to EIGHT total players per game. The game also provides an easy way to track multiple game wins for playoffs in case you have more than 15 to 20 minutes to play. No paper score cards and pencil needed - just move and block trophy shards to track and build your scores, and of course, Karma Crystal to track your block attempts!\n\n"

The \"good side\" are four powerful mages, while the \"evil side\" are eight demons.\n\nThough tactical, the game is pretty random, since the demons change their statistics every turn due to the changing phases of the moon and stars. Demons can change their status, there are 8 stages of it, from 100% material (they can be hurt and they can fight) to 100% spiritual (they can fight only using psychic attack, but can pass through the walls, etc.). Demons can use fireplaces to move, cast a curse, use pentagrams and holes to hell. Mages can use garlick, Torch of Ithilien's Temple, Ilih's Weed, wand, salt, Magic Book, Elvish Drop, pray and exorcise.\n\nOne of the last games by Sfera.\n\n"

            "Catharsis: Second Edition is a revised and remastered version of the original game. The gameplay is still the same, but we have updated the game majorly with better design, new characters, bosses, roles, powers, artwork, narrative and much more. We took all the feedback our fanbase gave us and made the game vastly better.\n\nCatharsis: Second Edition is a true solo & cooperative board game for players who are heroes trying to stop one of the many corruptions spreading through the lands. The game requires strategy, cooperation, and a touch of luck to succeed as the party fights through traps, monsters, and more. Each game is a different experience as each hero has a deck of powers they draw from, creating unique synergies every playthrough. Moreover, the players must hunt down a boss by progressing through its Boss deck, a unique deck of cards for each boss and randomized for each game. The players must carefully balance using their skills and creeping closer to death with burning through their morale and giving up in despair.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n"

            "A card deck that can be used in many ways. Can even be used as dice.\n\n54 cards + 2 rule cards forms a deck of 56 cards. The deck can be used as normal playing cards from 2 to ace + jokers. But also as a Japanese Hanafuda deck (48 cards + 6 jokers). The cards can be used playing Trumps, Dingo, Old Maid and other games also.\n\nYou can also battle with the characters. Pick five random cards each and do not show your opponent. The rest of the cards is placed in a \u201cdice pile\u201d. The player who most recently was in a fight (for real!) start. It might be back in preschool? Pick one of your characters and decide if you want to do a physical attack; the sword or a mental attack; the candle. Sword attacks are obviously defended by the shield and candle attacks are defended by the smiley face; humour.\n\nThe opponent picks out a character he thinks can defend without knowing the attacking value. Now both player draws a card from the dice pile and add the eyes on the card's die to their value, starting with the attacker. Highest total wins and is placed in front of the winner as a used character that won the battle. Also place the die card under it, it's the price for winning; a new recruit. The defeated character is placed in bottom of the dice pile (face up) and the die card (face down).\n\nFor example: player one (Kajsa) gets Lonar, Cadran, Minx, Dag and Moog. She chooses Lonar, one of the most powerful characters in the game and attacks with brains/candle (value 8). Player two (Kalle) chooses to defend with his character with highest humour, but that is still only Silver (5). Kajsa takes the first card in the dice pile which is Ulg. Ulg has however only 1 eye on his T6. 8 + 1 = 9 in mental attack. Kalle draws the next card and gets Donolen who has 5 eyes on the T6. 5 + 5 = 10. Silver wins and is placed in front of Kalle along with Donolen. They are now battle weary and not available until everybody have fought. Kajsa's Lonar is discarded under the dice pile along with Ulg. But defeated cards like Lonar can return as an undead and is placed face up! Ulg is placed face down like all other cards. Kalle wins the battle and starts the next round.\n\nIf the numbers are even the result is a tie, place both characters in front of the players, they are also battle weary and not available. However the dice cards are discarded and not won. Continue battling until all characters have fought. If both players have character cards left after everybody has fought, pick them up again and repeat everything. Shuffle the dice pile again and remember to keep the undead face up. The one with the least cards start the next battle. If even use rock-papers-scissors to decide. If an undead gets into your army keep it upside down on your hand. When played it automatically defeats both the opponent and him/herself. Remove the undead from the game after battle. The loser is the player who lost all of his/her cards. If one player has more characters to play than the other those are rested until next round.\n\nTry adding rules like that darker cards have +1 against lighter cards or that same silhouettes can\u2019t fight each other for example.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n"

Each time you visit the dungeon you will have an over arching goal that you need to achieve, but you can also pick up side quests and even some odd jobs from the tavern to further modify your adventure!\n\n6 stalwart Heroes are accompanied by their trusty fetch hound Albus. Each Hero has strengths and weakness' and it is up to you to decide if you will split the party to cover more ground or stick together in case a larger threat presents itself...\n\nIn the dungeon you will encounter wandering monsters who move about the board. Beware! These monsters might turn into raiding monsters and make their way to village.\n\nYou can mine for minerals to craft enhancements for your weapons. You can seek out and hunt down rare and legendary artifacts. You can send Albus back to the village to get a potion in a pinch.\n\nIf your quest is successful then the village celebrates in your honor and throws you a grand feast and presents your party with gifts. You can shop around for new gear from the ever changing marketplace, gamble some gold in the house of chance, visit a temple and pray for assistance and more!\n\nDon't get too comfortable because evil never rests and you'll find yourself back in the dungeon facing tougher challenges but hopefully better armed!\n\n"

            "Home Raiders is a game played with small scale models. These models represent the combatants that travel from a dimension known as the Inner-space to your very home, in order to battle for the dominance of your space. These fighters are little folk (which means that the scale of the models is actually 1:1) which exist in dimensions parallel to ours, and crash our world in order to thrive in theirs.\n\nThe basic game is very easy to grasp, and is a great option for a fast game that takes place in your actual living room coffee table, your office desk, or even around your kitchen sink. It takes no time at all to set up, so you can get your dice rolling in a breeze. If you are an experienced gamer, Home Raiders is a great choice for an improvised gaming session or even a well laid out match amongst a bunch of friends. If you want to play with your younger brothers and sisters, cousins or even your children, you won't find a better option to getting them started with this amazing hobby.\n\n"

Plentiful resources have begun appearing along fault lines almost as if they were gifts from beings dwelling in the depths below. The people thought the gifts a blessing but they could not have been more wrong...\n\nStratos: Light in the Darkness plays as both a themed extension to the original 'Stratos' and as a stand-alone 2-player game. Exciting new challenges await, including Monsters which add a co-operative element to the game. When combined with the original, Stratos: Light in the Darkness can be played with up to 7 players!\n\nStratos: Light in the Darkness has 5 character classes, each serving a distinct function. Characters move from space to space on a tile-based board which can be arranged randomly or according to set maps. Each character can perform up to 2 unique actions per turn with movement being a repeatable action. Available character actions (dependent on class) include Harvest, Travel, Search, Attack, Shoot, Defend, Cast and Use.\n\nPoints are awarded by defeating characters, casting unique spells, discovering treasures, hoarding resources, promoting characters, occupying strategic locations and slaying Monsters! The first player to reach a pre-determined number of Prosperity points (default 10) is declared the winner.\n\nStratos: Light in the Darkness is a product of Board and Tale Games Inc., a Canadian boardgame publisher based in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n"

In game 2 you are interviewing and hiring staff to work in your cafe. Game 3 enables you to choose the location of your restaurant. In game 4, you're able to select the best fixtures and fittings and create your own personal style, while game 5 helps you to get the word out to potential customers in the area.\n\nCompleting milestones within each games triggers bonuses - giving you extra turns and possibly creating a cascade of chaining actions. Players can also earn rosettes which give extra points at the end of the game.\n\nTotal up each of your mini games and add your rosette bonus to give your final score.
