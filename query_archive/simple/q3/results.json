            "Spite & Malice is Hasbro game based on the traditional card game of Spite and Malice (also sold as Spite 'N' Malice), which dates from at least the 19th century.  The object in all of these games is to be the first to play all the cards from your card stack to the build piles, using additional cards from your hand and your discard piles.\n\nThe Hasbro edition uses suitless numbered cards and adds action cards and other twists to the original (which is played with several standard 54-card decks, including jokers).\n\nSkip-Bo, Flinch and Da Capo! are based on the original Spite and Malice. Hasbro published a cat-themed edition of the game in 2003.\n\n"

            "The classic detective game!  In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file.  A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.\n\n\nPart of the \"Silver Line\" edition of Hasbro games. In addition to the distinctive black and silver motif, it includes \"invitation\" cards and the extra poison weapon from the 50th Anniversary edition. It also has new custom dice that trigger \"Clue\" event cards, and Dr. Orchid in the place of Ms. White.\n\n"

            "Head-to-Head Poker is a 2-player game that gives a good, fun introduction to Poker without the stress of betting or bluffing. The rules give 5 variations of play, such as simply drawing one card and playing it, or drawing two, choosing one to play on your side and giving your opponent the other and so on. A die is rolled to determine how each hand will be played. The game is played in 3 rounds, and 3-5 cards are turned up at the start of each round and get $200 in chips placed on them. Players take turns to lay up to 4 more cards on their side, to make the best 5 card hand they can. In this way, the original face-up card on each row is shared by the players, and you can easily see what you need to play to beat your opponent's hand.\n\nWhen the rows are complete, the player who has the winning hand on each row takes the chips in the middle. After playing the simple version, players can then use the betting rules, which let them raise the betting on the center cards. This makes the game more tense and more fun as the stakes are raised. Can you play the right card to beat your opponent and win $100s?\n\nDescription from the publisher:\n\nHead-to-Head Poker Game Parker Brothers and Hasbro Games.\nBuild the best hand in this poker duel! Six different games in one!\n\nExperience hand-to-hand combat- poker style! You and your opponent duel it out as you play cards on your respective sides of the board, sharing the common cards between you. But watch out! Each game has its own surprises and you could end up empty-handed. Build the strongest combinations on the board and take the chips to win!\n2 adult players.\n\n"

            "DON'T CRASH! Help the Monsters ride to work without breaking the Elevator!\n\nIn this cooperative math card game for kids, your Elevator is full of Monsters trying to go to work. If the Elevator gets too heavy, it breaks and everyone loses. If the Elevator reaches the 20th floor without breaking, everyone wins!\n\nMonsters in the Elevator won \"Best Family Game\" at the 2016 Boston Festival of Indie Games and is currently 1 of 5 finalists in the Hasbro \"Next Great family Game\" contest. It is designed for 2-6 player, ages 7-to-11 (and up), takes 2 minutes to learn and 5-20 minutes to play.\n\nThere are two decks: The DRAW and the FLOORS. The Draw deck contains MONSTERS with weight numbers on their bodies. Each Floor of the Elevator is a new round of the game, where players check the new Floor card and the Monster cards in the Elevator to see if any of those Monsters exit (get discarded). Then the players each enter a Monster card from their hand into the Elevator at the same time, and finally they add up the weights of the Monsters in the Elevator. If the sum is above the Elevator Capacity (50 x the number of players), the Elevator crashes and everyone loses. Otherwise, everyone gets a new card and play continues to the next Floor!\n\nThere are also ACTIONS in the Draw deck you can choose to play instead of a Monster, including cards that Change the Floor up or down, cards that make one Monster exit to Get Exercise or take a Phone Call, or cards that completely clear the Elevator with Giant Bees or a Fire Alarm. Families can decide how much they want to keep their hand secret and how much they want to share for easier cooperation.\n\nFinally, in the ADVANCED MODE the Floors are shuffled and played face-down, and without knowing what Floor might show up next the likelihood of crashing goes up and the game gets much more intense with every round.\n\n"

They also have a monetary value for use in making payments.\nMoney Cards are used to make payments.\n\nPlay:\nDraw two cards from the draw pile, or if you start your turn with no cards, draw five.\nPlay up to three cards from your hand face up either as: money into your bank, properties or improvements into your collection, or actions.  Action cards allow you to collect rent, receive money, take properties from others or cancel another action.  Cards placed in your bank may only be used as money.  When you must make a payment, you may use money from your bank or properties and improvements in your collection, but not cards in your hand.\nDiscard cards in excess of seven from your hand to the bottom of the draw pile.\n\nWin by announcing it on your turn when you have three complete property sets of different colors.  This ends the game.\n\nNot to be confused with Monopoly Deal, a 'lite' version of the same game that came out in 2014.\n\n"

            "(Note: Not to be confused with Anti-Monopoly II. Please be careful when submitting new versions of this game; basically, anything published after 1987 will almost certainly be Anti-Monopoly II and belong to that game, even if it's called \"Anti-Monopoly\". As for the reasons why this is so, please see the clarifications at the end of this article and the article of Anti-Monopoly II.)\n\nThe \"Bust~the~Trust!\" Game\n\nThe basic idea of the game is to end the monopolistic practices of the 3-company-combinations of the game board. The players are Trust-Busting lawyers going about the board slapping lawsuits on the monopolies. The winning trust buster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points when one of the players runs out of money.\n\nThere are 3 kinds of company combinations on the board: Oligopolies, Trusts and Monopolies, marked by one, two and three \"accusation circles\" respectively. \"Accusing\" is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of a combination are covered, the monopolistic practices of that combination have been ended. An accusation chip can be bought from the \"Budget-Commissioner\"; when lending money, he provides a Social-Credit card as an IOU.\n\nVariant rules are supplied for a Low-Budget Game and a Trading Game.\n\nAnspach fought --and won-- a vicious court battle against Hasbro (and others) over this game.\n\nAnti-Monopoly was briefly (1976-1982) published as \"Anti\" and \"Anti-Monopoly II\" was published as \"Choice\" whilst the company was forbidden to use the word \"Monopoly\". In 1984 after prevailing in court the company used the names \"Anti-Monopoly\" and \"Anti-Monopoly II\" for its two games.  In 1987, Anti-Monopoly was withdrawn and Anti-Monopoly II was renamed \"Anti-Monopoly\".  The game described here was produced as Anti-Monopoly before 1976 and from 1984 thru 1987.  The game produced as Anti-Monopoly after 1987 is a different game, with the same name. Plenty of potential for confusion there, eh?\n\n"
