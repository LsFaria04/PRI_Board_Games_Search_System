          "description": "Fiends and Light is a 6 in 1 electronic board game. The game board has 4 different platforms which can move independently or together depending on the option that the player chooses. This board mechanics gives rise to different forms of gameplay. There are 6 different games to play on Fiends and Light - a strategy game, a roleplaying game, 2 casual games and 2 resource manipulation games.\n\nGenesis is a strategy game, where the Fiends faction faces off against the Light faction in the Genesis War. Each player has 3 races, either Dragons, Orcs and Demons, or Angels, Animalia and Elementals. The races are represented by cards. Each card has a spell, ability, skill and racial effect. The health and attack power of the cards sum up to 18 points. Each race is strong against another race, but weak against another race.\n\nIn Genesis on the game board, players have to place marble units representing the race onto the platform, and use the controller to move the platforms to gain a competitive edge against the opponents. Units face off each other on the bridge and beyond. When facing off, players have to roll dice, use the spells skills and abilities of the units, or choose to engage in defence instead of offence. The first unit to reach the opposing end of the game board wins, or that a deck of race cards gets exhausted.\n\nGuidance is a roleplaying game. Players have to place pious believers in the gods Lovelyn from Light and Kylvaron from Fiends to go to the opposing enemy's battlefields to bring back the souls of the fallen warriors. Pious believers, when embarking on their journey, will gain heroic feats necessary to overcome the scenarios on the bridge, after which they have to listen to the hints of the gods to engineer a movement on the platforms using the controllers, to get the results that Lovelyn and Kylvaron want, before the pious believers are allowed to bring back the souls of the fallen warriors.\n\nIn Chase the Livestock, Demon Lord Azazeel is hungry and orders his minions to cook food to satiate his appetite. The minions then go onto the game board to chase after livestock. The livestock are represented by units with special abilities to run away from the minions by the player using the controller to control the platforms to move the livestock away from the minions, gaining a competitive advantage in escaping.\n\nIn MasterChef, Queen Seraphina thirsts for the perfect recipe. She orders her minions to look for food ingredients. Food ingredients are sentient and does not wish to be cooked. Using the platforms, players will play a mini-Sudoku game to clear the platforms of the numbers representing the ingredients.\n\nColor Abacus uses a proprietary design of an abacus stand to play the game. The abacus stand is used to record the color and number of resources to gather in the initial phase of the game. There are a total of 10 different rows of resources. After gathering the resources, players will have to play a numbers stacking game, similar to UNO, where the color and number of the resources matter in deciding who cops out of the round of numbers stacking.\n\n",

Game examples: 500, Blackjack, Bridge, Casino, Crazy Eights, Durak, Egyptian Ratscrew, Go Fish, Hearts, Memory, Old Maid, Poker, Rummikub, Slap Jack, Snap, UNO, Whist\n\nThe key mechanic is that each card lists 5 multiplication products at the bottom, below the main card value (ranging from 0 to 12). Mathematical versions of regular card games are created by combining three cards such that the product of two card values can be found among the 5 listed on a third card.\n\nE.g. if you take one card numbered 11 and one card numbered 12, you need to match these with a third card that has the product 132 at the bottom. These three cards can represent different equations such as multiplication 11x12=132, division 132/12=11 or even fractions 1/12=11/132.\n\n",

          "description": "The Mexican Revolution that began in 1910 with the overthrow of dictator Porfirio Diaz degenerated into civil war following the assassination of President Francisco Madero. By end of 1915 the forces of President Carranza were arrayed against a variety of leaders supporting either themselves or General Victoriano Huerta. Pancho Villa, commander of the Mexican Army del Norte, at first supported Carranza, but then went rogue after the US Government recognized Carranza\u2019s government. Historians still debate Villa\u2019s reasons, but in early March 1916 he decided to enter the US and raid the town of Columbus, New Mexico. Although the town was where the 13th Regiment US Cavalry was garrisoned, he knew most of the troopers were scattered along the border. Believing the town was only weakly guarded, his force of just under 500 men were to steal arms, provisions and horses while also wreaking as much havoc as possible. Such a raid he believed could galvanize the US government into a retaliatory strike that would drag Carranza\u2019s government into a war with the US it could not win, or a humiliating capitulation that would outrage the Mexican people. Either way, Villa reasoned, it would mean the downfall of Carranza.\n\nVilla\u2019s Vengeance is an introductory level wargame simulation portraying the March 9, 1916 raid on Columbus, New Mexico. Players are cast in the roles of Villa\u2019s raiding force and the defending US regular and militia forces.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n",

          "description": "Olympus is shaking to its foundations. Faith among the mortals is waning and with it the very power of the pantheon. Zeus is in a rage: \"Hear me, gods! I command you to send forth my MONSTROUS pets. Make them rain from the sky and erupt from the underworld. We will rekindle these mortals' faith - through FEAR!\"\n\nMonstrous is a game of gods and monsters, fear and faith, dexterous skills and tactical combos.\n\nPlayers are Greek gods throwing mythical monster cards from their hand onto a shared tableau of ancient Greek locations to gain as much 'Faith' as possible. But a strong guiding hand is not enough - cunning use of tactical monster and location powers is the key to gaining the most faith of all the gods, and the favor of Zeus.\n\nDuring setup, a number of large location cards equal to the number of gods are arranged on the table - these are selected from 12 ancient Greek cities where the insolent humans cower. Locations have special powers and provide Faith when hit by Monsters. Depending on the number of gods playing, each god has a randomly constructed deck of between 7 and 10 out of 12 mythical monster cards, each with their own special power. Each god shuffles and readies these decks, then draws 3 of their monster cards ready to throw at locations and monsters already on the table.\n\nOn their turn, a god chooses a single monster from their hand, and throws it (without their hand crossing the table edge) attempting to hit:\n1. a location - to use its special power, and any thrown monster power that affect locations, and gain its Faith.\n2. other monster cards on the table - to use the special power of their thrown monster on the other gods\u2019 monsters. \n3. ideally both at the same time!\n\nLook for the best cards to throw and the best targets to throw at. But beware: monsters may do unpredictable and dangerous things. Some monsters even act like traps on the table, taking effect as soon as they are hit. If Olympus is in play, powerful legendary monsters can be gained for gods to throw too.\n\nOnce a god has finished their turn, they draw a new monster and play proceeds to the next god. This proceeds until one god runs out of monster cards completely. Each other god then takes 1 final turn before the god with the highest Faith is declared the winner.\n\nMonstrous blends stunning art of mythic Greece with quick card throwing, fist pumping action and the tactical combos that gods and gamers love. Every game is different and there are optional rules to tailor your MONSTROUS experience for children, team play and longer games with legendary monsters.\n\nAnd yes, you can release the Kraken.\n\n",

Each hero offers unique attributes.\n\nThere are three different pathways to victory. Players can destroy enemy units(conquer), control territories(rule), or develop their kingdom(reign).

In this core volume, the focus is on the French and the British, two bitter rivals in the struggle for European preeminence during the time of Napoleon.\n\nAs with other games in the Commands & Colors genre, units in both armies can only move and fight when ordered. The command cards supply those orders, and their appearance in your hand (or not) provide an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities. You must maximize your opportunities by playing your command cards judiciously. How well you use the cards to handle the diverse units, their weapons, and the terrain, will determine victory.\n\n",

          "description": "From the designer (about his Commands and Colors system, C&C: Ancients, and Memoir' 44):\n\n\"Commands & Colors: Ancients depicts warfare from the Dawn of Military History (3000 BC) to the opening of the Dark Ages (400 AD). Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands & Colors, by design, is a unique historical wargame system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.\n\n\"The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.\n\n\"Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill, Commands & Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.\n\n\"The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards.\n\n\"The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol.\n\n\"The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive, yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.\"\n\n",
