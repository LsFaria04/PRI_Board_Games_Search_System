          "description": "COMPONENTS\n20 Ship tiles (4 aircraft carriers, 4 submarines, 4 destroyers, 4 battleships, 4 patrol boats)\n8 attack dice\n\nBattleship Express comes with two different games: The Captain\u2019s Game and The Admiral\u2019s Game. The Captain's Game ignore the ships powers on the cards.\n\nEach player receives 5 ship tiles, one of each ship: Battleship, Destroyer, Aircraft Carrier, Submarine, Patrol Boat. Each player places them in front of them in any order to make up their fleet.\n\nOn a player's turn they choose one of the ships in their Fleet to attack with and move it to the front of their line. Next the player chooses a ship of an opposing player to attack. The attacking player can only choose one of the first 2 ships in the line to attack. The attacking ship tile shows how many dice to roll. Roll that number of dice and check for hits. Each of the 8 dice is the same. 5 of the sides match the colors of the 5 ships, and the sixth side is a \u201cburst\u201d or \u201cwild\u201d. IF the player does not sink it, the dice are passed to the next player.\n\nSet aside any hits and then re-roll based on the attacking ship\u2019s powers. Once the number of hits equals or exceeds the defense number on the ship that's defending, it is sunk removed from play and the attacking player gets a point. The first player to an agreed number of set points wins. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the individual ship powers:\n\n\n     Battleship: Declare target. Roll all 8 dice a total of 4 times. Bursts do not count as hits.\n     Destroyer: Declare target. Roll 6 dice a total of 2 times. Bursts count as 2 hits.\n     Aircraft Carrier: Roll 6 dice THEN declare your target, then roll 1 more time. Bursts count as 1 hit. The Aircraft Carrier can also attack from anywhere in your line, so you don\u2019t have to move it to the front where it is vulnerable.\n     Submarine: Roll 3 dice a total of one time. A single Burst will sink whatever you are attacking. Submarines can attack any ship at any place in a Fleet.\n     Patrol Boat: Roll 5 dice a total of 3 times. Bursts count as 1 hit.\n\n\nPart of the Hasbro Express Line.\n\n",

When a player is ready to crack the case, they secretly look at the cards placed inside the Case File envelope to reveal who was the brains and who was the brawn behind the crime. The Clue Diced game is a compact and portable game making it a great game for travel and for on-the-go play.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\nPut simply: Instead of moving pawns around the board and making a guess in a room (as in classic Clue), players simply roll 4 dice and pick a combination of people and roles to gain information about.\n\nIncludes 2 levels of difficulty.\nIncludes game case, 18 suspect cards, 4 dice, dice labels, case file envelope, suggestion board, detective pad, and game rules.\n\n",

          "description": "Don't Go to Jail is a dice game derived from Monopoly. The game board depicts the monopolies found in the original game, with the property groups color-coded as in Monopoly. Each property group has a given dollar value, which you can collect by rolling the dice and collecting that group.\n\nOn a turn, you roll ten dice, set aside any die reading \"Go,\" \"to\" or \"jail\", then set aside any color group dice that you wish. If the \"Go,\" \"to\" and \"jail\" dice are set aside, your turn ends immediately, and you score nothing. Otherwise you can choose to either (1) stop and score for what you've rolled or (2) roll again with any dice not set aside, once again setting aside the \"Go,\" \"to\" or \"jail\" dice, etc. The dice have a couple of \"Wild\" faces, and you can use at most one Wild in a color group. (If you roll the proper color, you can replace a Wild die in a group and roll that die again on a later turn.)\n\nIf you stop, you score for all completed color groups and one incomplete color group. Your goal is to be the first player to reach a predetermined dollar amount or to have the most money at the end of a pre-set number of turns.\n\nMonopoly Express \u2013 an updated version of this game that was first released in the UK and Europe, then later in the U.S. \u2013 alters the gameplay as follows:\n\n\n     The policeman from the \"Go To Jail\" corner of the board game replaces the words \"Go,\" \"to\" and \"jail\".\n     One blank face on one of the policeman dice depicts a green \"GO\" arrow. A player earns $200 each time they roll GO, but they lose this money if they bust due to policemen. \n     The game includes an eleventh \"House/Hotel\" die that can earn (or lose) a player Houses (worth $1,000 each), earn Hotels (worth $5,000, but only if a player has already earned four houses) and a \"Get Out Of Jail Free\" side that negates a policeman (including a policeman that would bust a player). This die cannot be rolled until a player completes a property group (i.e., neither railroads nor utilities).\n     The Wild faces are replaced by the Chance \"?\" logo; the ? act as a Wild, but unlike a Wild it cannot be replaced.\n     The first player to have at least $15,000 wins immediately; players don't complete the round.\n\n\nIn 2021, this game was re-released in the US as Monopoly DICED! with square packaging rather than the round used for Express.\n\n",

Fourteen cards are laid out at the start of the game, each showing the symbols required to claim this card, with the symbols separated into battle lines. The cards are grouped into sets, with sets varying in size from one to four cards.\n\nA player starts their turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show different symbols. They then select a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If they can do this, they then roll the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if they cannot conquer a line, they remove one die from play, the rolls again. Their turn ends when either they conquer every line on the card (in which case they claims it) or they no longer have dice available to roll.\n\nEach card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional line to do so. If a player has claimed all the cards from one set, however, those castles are secure and can no longer be stolen. What's more, these cards are now also worth more points.\n\nWhen the last card is claimed, players tally the points from the cards they have claimed, and whoever has the highest score wins.\n\n",

The first person to finish down-stacking wins. If a pyramid collapses while it is being built, it must be corrected before moving on to the next. However, if a fumble occurs during the down-stacking process, you may continue to down stack without having to rebuild the pyramid. The game has rules for one-on-one and relay race competition, and also stacking tips. \n Kup Stax is actually mentioned in the \"Grade 5 Physical Education Required Curriculum\" as a way for students to \"demonstrate perceptual motor efficiency\".\n\nSimilar to:\n\n    Crazy-Cups\n\n\n",

Over a number of rounds, the players will engage in a series of three battles, with victory points going to the winner of a majority of the battles. The first player to score 5 victory points is the winner.\n\nThis game re-implements Craig van Ness' earlier design, Clash of the Light Sabers, which has been remade 2 times before. This version is a mixture of the previous Iron Man battling card game (from the first film) and the original edition. The extra cards from the Iron Man battling game have been included, but other cards (1 each of value 1, 2, and 3) have been removed from each deck.\n\nPublisher's Description:\nChoose a suit and prepare for action! Jump into a head-to-head battle of points and power and side with the heroic IRON MAN or his fearless combatant, WAR MACHINE. Take no prisoners in this fast-paced, action-packed card duel and keep score with the IRON MAN and WAR MACHINE game pieces. Be clever and use your cards wisely to out-play and outlast your opponent!\n\nIncludes 2 game pieces, 55 Iron Man battle cards, 55 War Machine battle cards, 5 Iron Man victory cards, 5 War Machine victory cards and instructions.\n\nFor 2 or more players.

The game still features the patented SPLIT half cards and looks much better than the original (design wise) and seems to have some adjustments to the rules.\n\nIn this surprisingly solid offering from Hasbro, players use cards to take actions on a board.  The cards depict halves of a standard deck of cards, and players attempt to match the halves with those next to the board.  Depending on the quality of the match (perfect, strong, weak), the action is likewise powerful or weak.  The object of the game is to place a series of your markers in a continuous line across the board.  Also the game is scalable for two to six players, with four through six using partners to keep the action interesting.\n\nRe-implemented as:\n\n    Split (Revised Edition)\n\n\n",

Themed around the popular UK discount retailer Home Bargains, the game lets players experience the excitement of building a retail empire with a focus on the brand's iconic stores and locations.\n\nIn this edition, players begin their journey at the first Home Bargains store in Old Swan, Liverpool, and navigate through other significant locations such as Clydebank, Pontefract, Newtownabbey, Harlow, and Poole. As they move around the board, players will buy, trade, and develop these stores and warehouses, aiming to dominate the retail landscape.\n\nGame-play follows the traditional Monopoly format, with players rolling dice to advance around the board, drawing Chance and Community Chest cards that can either help or hinder their progress. Instead of houses and hotels, players invest in Home Bargains stores and warehouses, adding a fresh and thematic twist to property development.\n\nThe goal remains the same: bankrupt your opponents by acquiring properties, charging rent, and strategically managing your assets. With official licensing from Hasbro, Monopoly: Home Bargains Edition provides a fun, competitive experience that combines the beloved elements of classic Monopoly with the charm and familiarity of Home Bargains.\n\n",
